colour.js
=========

Colour manipulation class

This is an old class I originally wrote for PHP years ago and then ported to 
Javascript. I have also written from scratch [a similar class in 
Python](https://github.com/tremby/py-colour), which I intend to use as a base 
and port back to Javascript as version colour.js version 2. Until then, there is 
no documentation for this class except in the source code.
